# Using Euler's method to compare the harmonic and mathematical pendulums at large initial angles

In this project we used FORTRAN and Python to simulate and compare two pendulums, one being a simple harmonic one (using the small angle approx) and the mathematical one (which does not use it).  

We simulated large initial angles to see how the small angle approx fails when we start farther from the equilibrium and leave the local minima.

We used the Euler's method for differential equations to simulate both pendulums in Fortran and then used Python (numpy and matplotlib) to plot the data.
